Key Points:

Problem 1: 
Asynchronous Operations:
I have created a function that takes an array of image URLs and download each URL with asynchronous method and covert each url into blob url. Loading appears until all downloads are completed, then i have returned the downloaded blob array and shows it in the same order as the URLs.

Problem 2: 
Error Handling:
I have created a function that fetches data from an API endpoint using fetch method. Loading appears until promise is fulfilled or rejected. After this function checks what is response status code. If status code is 200 then we shows data to the user otherwise shows upcoming error message.

Problem 3: 
File System Operations:
I have developed a function in Node.js's that takes directoryPath and fileExtension then reads the directory and list of all files with specific extension (.html).

Problem 4 & Problem 5:
I have developed an application using the MERN stack, which covers multiple things.

1: Database Interaction (MongoDb).
2: Implemented endpoints for CRUD that require authentication to access the resources.
3: User Sign-in and Sign-up.
4: Implemented JWT authentication.
5: Protected Routes (Home, Add Note, Profile).
6: Notifications with React Toastify.
7: Error Handling and Express Data Validations.
8: Only specific user can access their resources.
9: Routing with React Router Dom.
